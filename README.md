# Turn Tuning (with real robot)

* Create a new WPILib project.
* Copy this README, and put it in a file named `README.md` in the root directory of the new project.

Check in with a mentor.

* Install the Third-Party Library for CTRE (Phoenix), and the library for the NavX (Kauai Labs).
* Set up a basic program to drive the robot with a controller in teleop.
* Create a NavX object, and get the angle the robot is turned at and put it on the SmartDashboard. Put this in `robotPeriodic`. [View documentation for the NavX here.](https://www.kauailabs.com/public_files/navx-mxp/apidocs/java/com/kauailabs/navx/frc/AHRS.html)

Check in with a mentor once you have this working (or if you need help!).

* In autonomous, create a program that turns the robot 90 degrees.

Check in with a mentor once you have something close. We'll discuss how to make it better from there!
